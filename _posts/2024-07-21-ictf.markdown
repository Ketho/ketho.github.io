It's a bunch of Chinese but it doesn't make any sense, like some kind of [mojibake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake). But when opening the file in a hex editor it suddenly made sense.

In Packet Tracer you can view the Command Log with `ctrl-shift-v`. This is convenient to show the configuration used for the routers. I used [https://ccnax.com/cisco-type-7-password-decryption/](https://ccnax.com/cisco-type-7-password-decryption/) to then decode the password.

> I lost my dog in Minecraft. Can you find him? The name of the dog wrapped in `ictf{}` is the flag.
> 
> The dog's name is 16 hex characters, anything else is not correct.

I made a major mistake here, I assumed the name of the dog would literally be wrapped in `ictf{}` ü§¶

It's possible to find the dog with [NBTExplorer](https://github.com/jaquadro/NBTExplorer). 
By searching for `CollarColor: 11` and skipping until you find `variant: minecraft:black`, the first match will be in `entities -> r.-1.-1.mca -> Chunk [30, 28]`.

Alternatively they can be found by killing all other dogs that are not the same breed and do not have the same color collar from [Entity format: wolf: CollarColor](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Entity_format#Mobs).

There were actually two dogs that would be eligible for the flag, but we only tried using the first one for the flag.
```
/kill @e[type=minecraft:wolf,nbt={variant:"minecraft:ashen"}]
/kill @e[type=minecraft:wolf,nbt={variant:"minecraft:chestnut"}]
/kill @e[type=minecraft:wolf,nbt={variant:"minecraft:pale"}]
/kill @e[type=minecraft:wolf,nbt={variant:"minecraft:rusty"}]
/kill @e[type=minecraft:wolf,nbt={variant:"minecraft:snowy"}]
/kill @e[type=minecraft:wolf,nbt={variant:"minecraft:spotted"}]
/kill @e[type=minecraft:wolf,nbt={variant:"minecraft:striped"}]
/kill @e[type=minecraft:wolf,nbt={variant:"minecraft:woods"}]
/kill @e[type=minecraft:wolf,nbt={CollarColor:1b}] # Orange
/kill @e[type=minecraft:wolf,nbt={CollarColor:2b}] # Magenta
/kill @e[type=minecraft:wolf,nbt={CollarColor:3b}] # Light Blue
/kill @e[type=minecraft:wolf,nbt={CollarColor:4b}] # Yellow
/kill @e[type=minecraft:wolf,nbt={CollarColor:5b}] # Lime
/kill @e[type=minecraft:wolf,nbt={CollarColor:6b}] # Pink
/kill @e[type=minecraft:wolf,nbt={CollarColor:7b}] # Gray
/kill @e[type=minecraft:wolf,nbt={CollarColor:8b}] # Light Gray
/kill @e[type=minecraft:wolf,nbt={CollarColor:9b}] # Cyan
/kill @e[type=minecraft:wolf,nbt={CollarColor:10b}] # Purple
/kill @e[type=minecraft:wolf,nbt={CollarColor:12b}] # Brown
/kill @e[type=minecraft:wolf,nbt={CollarColor:13b}] # Green
/kill @e[type=minecraft:wolf,nbt={CollarColor:14b}] # Red
/kill @e[type=minecraft:wolf,nbt={CollarColor:15b}] # Black
```

So this cute variant should not be killed.
```
/kill @e[type=minecraft:wolf,nbt={variant:"minecraft:black"}]
/kill @e[type=minecraft:wolf,nbt={CollarColor:11b} # Blue
```
